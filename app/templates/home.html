    <div class="columns">
        <div class="column">
          <strong>Manufacturing</strong>: create Products and Bill of Materials. Both support import from CSV.<br>
          Or skip Product creation and import a BOM with associated BOM Lines from CSV.<br>
          CSV must contain a top product (assembly) and products (component parts) for individual BOM Lines. See Help for samples.<br>
          If a product associated with a BOM Line is not found, it will be created automatically.<br>
          Products are uniquely identified by name, and duplicates are skipped.
        </div>
        <div class="column">
        <strong>Purchase</strong>: create Supplier(s).<br>
          Now that you have Suppliers and Products, you can create Purchase Orders either manually or import from CSV.<br>
          As soon as PO is marked as completed, the following records will be automatically created in the <strong>Inventory</strong> module:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>Inventory Items for each product on a PO Line,</li>
            <li>Stock Moves from Supplier to Warehouse.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
        <strong>Manufacturing</strong>: create an MO (Manufacturing Order).<br>
          Select a BOM for the MO. BOM Lines will populate automatically.<br>
          To mark an MO as Reserved, each BOM Line must have the required quantity of components available as a result of completed POs.<br>
          If the required quantity for each BOM Line is available, you may reserve the components.<br>
          This will automatically update Inventory Items and create Stock moves from Warehouse to Factory.<br>
          If an MO is cancelled prior to being completed, the these changes will automatically triggered in the <strong>Inventory</strong> module:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>new Stock Moves from Factory back to Warehouse will be created,</li>
            <li>Inventory Items will be updated</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
